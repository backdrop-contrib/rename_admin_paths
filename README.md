# Rename Admin Paths

The purpose of this module is to secure the Backdrop backend by overriding admin
 paths.

This module allows you to:

- rename paths like '/admin/...' to '/something/...'
- rename paths like '/user/..' to '/something-else/..'

It can be effective against registration spam bots or malicious people.
